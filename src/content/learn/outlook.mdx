# Outlook

This section identifies trends and areas of uncertainty relevant to vault evaluation. Claims are tagged as observations (current evidence) or projections (directional expectations).

## Active Trends

### Curator Professionalization

**Observation:** The curator function is separating from infrastructure development. Dedicated curation firms now operate across multiple platforms rather than building proprietary infrastructure.

**What to track:** Curator performance data across platforms; methodology documentation; incident response history independent of infrastructure provider.

### Institutional Infrastructure Adaptation

**Observation:** Vault infrastructure is adding capabilities for institutional requirements: permissioned access, compliance integrations, standardized reporting, and formalized security programs.

**What to track:** Feature availability against your compliance requirements; security program maturity; reporting format compatibility with your systems.

### Integration Flexibility

**Observation:** Some protocols are enabling external teams to develop integrations independently after auditing.

**What to track:** Integration approval processes; audit requirements for new integrations; your exposure to integrations not vetted by the platform team.

### Tokenization Growth

**Observation:** Tokenized asset products have grown significantly in recent years, with treasury-backed products among the largest categories.

**What to track:** Issuer credit quality; redemption mechanics and timelines; legal structure enforceability in your jurisdiction.

## Areas of Uncertainty

These topics affect vault evaluation but lack clear resolution. Understanding the uncertainty helps calibrate expectations.

### Regulatory Treatment

**Current state:** Treatment varies across jurisdictions and continues to evolve.

**What to track:** Vault domicile and applicable regulations; your jurisdiction's treatment of vault shares; curator registration requirements; cross-border restrictions affecting your participation.

### Emerging Standards

**Current state:** Technical standards are emerging for vault interfaces. ERC-4626 has broad adoption; ERC-7540 (asynchronous) and ERC-7575 (multi-asset) are newer proposals with limited deployment. Operational, security, and regulatory standards remain informal or fragmented. (Example: Tokenized Vault Foundation)

**Practical approach:** Monitor technical standards as they develop and adoption grows. Expect operational standards to develop over time. Absence of formal standards increases the burden on independent diligence.

### Stress Resilience

**Current state:** Many vaults have not been tested under severe ecosystem-wide stress.

**What to track:** Withdrawal queue behavior during past volatility; oracle performance during price dislocations; protocol pause history; your maximum acceptable exit time under stress.

### Capacity Constraints

**Current state:** Some yield opportunities have natural capacity limits.

**What to track:** TVL growth rate versus yield compression; strategy capacity disclosures; underlying opportunity depth relative to vault size.
