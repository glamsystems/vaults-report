# Overview

This resource is for institutional allocators, protocol evaluators, and operational teams assessing vault infrastructure. It supports three decisions: whether to use a vault, which vault architecture fits your requirements, and what ongoing monitoring posture to maintain.

## Key Conclusions

**Trust exists at two levels.** Depositors must evaluate both protocol-level risk (infrastructure upgrade authority, core contract security) and vault-level risk (owner configuration, delegate permissions). Neither level compensates for weakness in the other.

**Architecture determines guarantees, not marketing.** Two vaults described identically can have fundamentally different risk profiles. One may allow instant upgrades by a single key; another may require multisignature approval with extended timelocks. One may guarantee withdrawals under all conditions; another may queue them indefinitely during stress. The only way to understand what protection you actually have is to examine the specific architecture.

**Curator selection typically dominates outcomes within a given infrastructure.** Infrastructure sets boundaries on what is possible; curators determine what actually happens within those boundaries. Two curators using identical infrastructure can produce dramatically different results. When evaluating a vault, the operating party's track record, methodology, and operational discipline matter as much as the underlying platform.

**Risk does not reduce to a single score.** Vault risk comprises distinct categories: smart contract vulnerabilities, oracle dependencies, governance and upgrade exposure, delegate and operational failures, contagion from shared infrastructure, and liquidity constraints. These interact under stress. A vault robust to any single risk may be vulnerable to combinations.

**Minimum bars exist.** Some configurations should prompt careful scrutiny regardless of other merits: single-key upgrade authority without timelock, no documented incident response capability, withdrawal restrictions without clear conditions and rationale, or opaque offchain custody without attestations.

## Market Context

The vault ecosystem has grown significantly, with billions of dollars now held across major vault platforms. Separately, tokenized real-world assets have expanded substantially, with treasury-backed products and private credit representing the largest categories. This growth reflects both increased DeFi activity and institutional adoption of onchain asset management. Infrastructure has matured: multi-role permission systems, timelocked governance, and formal security programs are now common among established protocols.

However, gaps remain. Side-pocketing mechanisms common in traditional funds are largely absent, meaning impaired positions can block redemptions for all depositors. Stress-tested withdrawal guarantees vary widely. Curator accountability frameworks are underdeveloped. Regulatory treatment remains unsettled.

## Out of Scope

This resource does not provide specific protocol recommendations, legal or tax advice, or investment guidance. It does not evaluate individual vaults or curators. Examples are illustrative, not endorsements.
