# Evaluation Framework

This framework enables structured diligence. It provides minimum acceptable standards, areas requiring careful assessment, and evidence checklists.

## Minimum Acceptable Standards

These represent baseline requirements for a conservative institutional diligence posture. Requirements apply at both protocol and vault levels (see Architecture: Two Levels of Trust).


| Dimension | Level | Minimum Bar | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Upgrade Authority** | Protocol | No unilateral control: multi-sig with threshold ≥2-of-n (n ≥ 3), including ≥1 signer controlled by a separate organization, OR immutable | Upgrades to shared protocol components can affect many or all vaults; single-key control is an unacceptable concentration risk |
| **Upgrade Timelock** | Protocol | Timelock exceeding your review \+ redemption timeline, with withdrawals available during the delay (unless explicitly disclosed and accepted) | A timelock can provide an exit window before changes take effect (if withdrawals are available during the delay) |
| **Audit Coverage** | Protocol | Core contracts audited by an independent security firm, with scope disclosed and core components covered | Unaudited core protocol code fails this minimum bar |
| **Owner Configuration** | Vault | Multi-sig with threshold ≥2-of-n, or a timelock on config changes that prevents instant unilateral changes and provides an exit window (withdrawals available during the delay) | Single-key vault owner with instant changes creates unilateral control risk |
| **Delegate Scope** | Vault | Permissions bounded by explicit allowlists/caps/policy checks (on-chain where possible) | Unbounded delegation enables catastrophic misuse |
| **Withdrawal Mechanics** | Vault | Documented behavior (normal AND stress) | Must understand exit conditions |
| **Incident Response** | Both | Documented, designated responders, and evidence of periodic testing | Needed at both levels |
| **Monitoring** | Both | Monitoring with alerting for governance/admin changes, key role changes, and vault health signals (TVL/flows, withdrawals) | Protocol and vault events both matter |


## Areas Requiring Careful Assessment

Some configurations warrant thorough evaluation rather than automatic disqualification. These require understanding the specific context and rationale:

**Withdrawal restrictions:** Some strategies legitimately require the ability to restrict withdrawals under certain conditions (e.g., committed capital strategies, strategies accessing illiquid positions, strategies with lock-up periods). What matters is:

- Are the conditions under which withdrawals can be restricted clearly documented?

- Is the restriction mechanism appropriate for the strategy type?

- Are there bounds on the duration or scope of restrictions?

- Is the rationale transparent and reasonable?

- What recourse exists if restrictions are applied inappropriately?

**Shorter timelocks:** Some vaults may operate with shorter timelocks due to strategy requirements. Evaluate whether the duration provides an adequate exit window for your specific needs.

**Concentrated authority:** Some vaults vest significant authority in a single party. This may be acceptable depending on the party's track record, accountability mechanisms, and the nature of the vault.

## Explicit Disqualifiers

These configurations should disqualify regardless of other merits:

**Protocol-level disqualifiers:**

- Single-key contract/program upgrade authority without any timelock

- No audit of core protocol contracts

- No documented protocol incident response process

**Vault-level disqualifiers:**

- Single-key vault owner with instant config changes and no timelock

- Offchain custody without verifiable reserve/custody reporting (e.g., attestations, audits, or regulated disclosures)

- Unbounded delegate permissions with no monitoring

- Withdrawal restrictions with no documented conditions or rationale

## Evaluation Checklist

### Protocol-Level Assessment

- [ ] Who holds contract/program upgrade authority (e.g., team multisig, DAO governance, immutable)?

- [ ] What timelock applies to protocol upgrades?

- [ ] Does the protocol multisig include at least one independent signer (different organization)?

- [ ] What is the protocol's audit history and security track record?

- [ ] What protocol-level configurations affect all vaults (fees, oracles, integration allowlists)?

- [ ] Has the protocol been upgraded before? What was the process?

### Vault-Level Assessment

- [ ] Who owns this specific vault?

- [ ] What timelock applies to vault configuration changes?

- [ ] What delegate roles exist and what can each do?

- [ ] Are there onchain constraints (e.g., caps/allowlists/policies) limiting delegate actions?

- [ ] What is the delegate revocation path, and is revocation timelocked or immediate?

- [ ] What emergency capabilities exist at the vault level?

### Withdrawals

- [ ] What is the withdrawal mechanism?

- [ ] What is the expected withdrawal time under normal conditions (documented or measured baseline)?

- [ ] What happens during high redemption demand (queue rules, penalties)?

- [ ] Who can restrict withdrawals and under what documented conditions?

- [ ] Is there a mechanism to segregate impaired/illiquid positions (if applicable)?

- [ ] Is the withdrawal mechanism appropriate for the strategy type?

### Integrations

- [ ] What integrations are enabled?

- [ ] Are integrations enabled per-vault or automatically?

- [ ] What can each integration do once enabled?

- [ ] What happens if an underlying protocol pauses or is exploited?

### Incident Response

- [ ] Is there documented incident response at protocol and vault levels?

- [ ] Who are the designated responders?

- [ ] Has the process been tested?

### Manager / Curator Assessment

- [ ] What is the track record across market conditions?

- [ ] How do they communicate during problems?

- [ ] What conflicts of interest exist?

### Cross-Chain (if applicable)

- [ ] What finality assumptions does the bridge make?

- [ ] How is message validity verified?

- [ ] Where are custody points during transit?

- [ ] What is the bridge's incident history?

### Offchain Dependencies

- [ ] What offchain services are required?

- [ ] What happens if they are unavailable?

- [ ] Are there offchain custody components? What attestations exist?

### Fee Structure

- [ ] What are all fee types (management, performance, protocol, execution)?

- [ ] Who controls the fee-receiving addresses?

- [ ] How are fee changes governed?

- [ ] For performance fees, is there a high-water mark?

## Evidence to Request


| Artifact | What It Shows |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Audit reports** (full scope) | Components covered, findings, remediation |
| **Timelock configuration** | Actual durations, which actions are timelocked, and any bypass/emergency paths that can execute without delay |
| **Signer documentation** | Who signs, organization separation, key custody posture (where disclosed) |
| **Incident response runbook** | Procedures, responders, test results |
| **Withdrawal mechanics spec** | Behavior under normal and stress, mechanism rules (queue/epoch/gating/instant), restriction conditions |
| **Role authority map** | Role → permissions → limits → revocation path |
| **Fee disclosure** | All fee types, calculation, governance |
| **Incident history** | Past problems, detection time, resolution |


## Ongoing Monitoring

**Weekly**: Withdrawal wait indicator (queue/epoch/gating), position concentration, governance/admin actions

**Monthly**: Curator reporting quality, performance vs. expectations, TVL patterns

**Event-driven**: Any incident in underlying protocols, governance changes, market stress

**Exit triggers**: Define thresholds that would prompt review or exit before they are needed.
